# ReviewsClassifier
Created a naive bayes classifier for IMDB movie reviews' Dataset

In this problem, I used the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification. The
dataset for this problem is a subset of IMDB movie review data. First entry of each row
is a review followed by a sentiment. The sentiment attached with the review has two class
labels: positive and negative. Given a review, task is to predict the sentiment of the
review
